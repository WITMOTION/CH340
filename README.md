Double-confirmed which platform you bought and contact the corresponding team by the provided way

Sending a message including the problem and necessary description would be highly helpful to give a workable solution with details

Leave a note indicating the platform you placed the order, the order ID, so it is intuitive to check the model you purchase and accessory you may buy

For a complicated issue like calibration, PIN connection, configurations, it is recommended to provide necessary files including screenshots, taking several pictures, or shooting videos. A short video including the PIN connection, software setup, operation details would be preferred. It would be further help for remote diagnostics.
